**MIKE STUDIO PRO** is a high-performance, enterprise-grade raster-to-vector reconstruction platform. Built with a proprietary asynchronous architecture, it enables professional designers to transform pixel-based assets into infinitely scalable vector graphics with cinema-grade precision—all within the browser.

## 🛠 Strategic Architecture

Unlike standard vectorizers, MIKE STUDIO PRO operates on a **Quantum-Sync Matrix**. This means the processing core is decoupled from the UI thread, ensuring a **zero-freeze (Lag-Free)** experience even when handling 4K high-density textures.

### Core Engines:
*   **Adaptive Scaling Engine:** Automatically optimizes internal buffers to prevent browser memory overflow.
*   **Pixel Matrix Pre-Processor:** Integrated Luma-Thresholding and Contrast-Gain shaders to prime images for tracing.
*   **Synced Viewport Matrix:** A mathematical bonding of Source and Vector artboards for 100% synchronous navigation and zooming.
*   **Ultra-Res Rasterizer:** An upscaling pipeline that allows for **PNG export at 10x original resolution** (up to 10,000px).

## ✨ Key Enterprise Features

*   **Synced Side-by-Side Viewing:** Compare source pixels and vector curves in real-time with a perfectly synchronized transformation matrix.
*   **Industrial Toolset:**
    *   🎯 **Quantum Eyedropper:** Sample raw pixel colors directly from the engine's buffer.
    *   🔍 **Optical Lens:** High-fidelity 6x magnification lens for deep path inspection.
*   **Path Intelligence:** Real-time color clustering and vertex mapping with live palette manipulation.
*   **Environment Presets:**
    *   `GRID_SYS`: High-precision engineering mode with procedural grid.
    *   `CLEAN_SYS`: Minimalist preview mode for final asset inspection.
*   **Telemetry Dashboard:** Live monitoring of FPS, RAM usage, and kernel latency.

## ⌨️ Professional Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Space` | **Pan Tool:** Navigate the matrix |
| `E` | **Eyedropper:** Sample exact HEX colors |
| `L` | **Quantum Lens:** Activate optical magnification |
| `R` | **Reset Matrix:** Re-center artboards to 100% |
| `+/-` | **Zoom:** Adjust magnification level |

## 🔒 Privacy & Performance

*   **100% Client-Side:** No image data ever leaves the user's machine. Processing is handled locally via GPU-accelerated JavaScript.
*   **Non-Blocking Logic:** Heavy tasks are divided into micro-tasks using asynchronous threading to maintain a constant 60 FPS.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is a standalone enterprise module. To deploy:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Launch `index.html` via any modern web engine (Chrome/Edge recommended for GPU acceleration).
3. For server-side hosting, simply drop into any static provider (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
